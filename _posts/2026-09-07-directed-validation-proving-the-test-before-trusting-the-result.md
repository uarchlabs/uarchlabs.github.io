# Directed Validation: Proving the Test Before Trusting the Result

## Abstract

Three RVA23 Co-Design sessions ran twenty-one tasks to finish unit-level
verification of the Pacino TAGE and ITTAGE branch predictors. Going in, the
counter and usefulness write paths had been proven by reading them back out of
RAM and the rest had not. Aging had never been enabled to this point.  Sixteen
of the tasks were verification work: one specification rule row at a time, with
entries seeded directly into table memory, the result read back out of RAM, and
every field proven alone before any test mixed fields together.

Four times in the range something plausible was asserted with nothing behind
it. A regression count was carried forward without a run behind it, which hid
46 failing tests through several sessions of RTL change. A failure
classification named the RTL as inverted without checking the specification
first; the specification showed the RTL conforming on all 33 rows and five
tests transposed, so repairing the RTL would have broken a working block. A
defect was reported, argued harmless, and the task marked itself complete,
with no test behind the argument; the defect was real and corrupted the
higher-priority table. A test passed without ever having been seen to fail,
and that task was abandoned.

The last of these produced a standing requirement in the methodology that every
check demonstrate it can fail, which took three forms. Where a defect was
fixed, the test ran against the unfixed design first. Where the design already
conformed, a defect was introduced deliberately and then reverted, leaving no
net RTL change. Where neither applied, the stimulus was seeded so that a wrong
answer would be visible.

Twelve of the sixteen verification tasks ended with no RTL change. Four
defects were found and fixed, two of which are the same defect in the two
predictors: a missing guard that let the use-alternate counter move on a
comparison carrying no training signal. Fifteen technical debt items closed,
and both predictors ended the range directed-validated at the unit level.

## What had not been tested

Before this range, the TAGE and ITTAGE update paths had been fixed where
they were known to be broken and left alone where they were not. The
counter and usefulness write paths had been proven by RAM readback. The
epoch, target, allocation, aging and prediction-side paths had not. Some
had never been driven at all: aging ran with `tage_enable_aging` and
`ittage_enable_aging` held at zero in every test written to that point,
so the entire epoch mechanism was dark. Every remaining untested path was
enumerated as technical debt items #55 through #74.

Two rules governed how that work would be done. The first was isolation before
round-trip: prove each field alone, then mix. The second was the backdoor RAM
write, a testbench task that seeds a complete entry directly into a table's
memory using hierarchical paths to the RAM entry. 

Both rules were inherited. This range added a third, that every check must
demonstrate it can fail. The requirement was written after BP-050 was abandoned
for arguing its test would have caught a defect rather than showing that it
did.

## Structural rework, and what it exposed

The redundant bus dimensioning was not found in this range. It was recorded in
session-040 as TD #45, an update-index simplification, and the description was
wrong: it asked for per-table ports when the per-table dimension was itself
the defect. Session-046 invalidated the entry, marked it wrong in
`CLOSED_TECH_DEBT.md`, and moved the real fix to TD #66. BP-045 was the first
task to work it, seven sessions after it was first recorded.

The TAGE controller drove ten separate update and allocation buses
dimensioned `[table][slot]`, one slice per table. Only one table per slot
is the provider or the allocation target on any update, so every update
drove one meaningful slice and `TAGE_NUM_TABLES-1` unused ones. BP-045
collapsed them to `[slot]`, with the target table identified by the
`*_tbl_sel_u0` selects that already existed. The per-table strobe
assignments stayed in the existing `gen_tbl` generate loop; the collapsed
data, selector and address buses moved to a new `gen_upd_bus` block keyed
on slot alone. `tage_table.sv` needed no change. Its input ports were
already dimensioned by slot, and only the interconnect above the module
had the redundant dimension.

One of the ten could not collapse. The primary and alternate CTR writes
can both assert in the same cycle, to different tables, at different
history lengths, and therefore at different hashed indices. A single
shared index bus carries one value per slot. `t_alt_upd_index_u0` was
added alongside the primary update index, giving three index buses:
primary update, alternate update, and allocation. None of this was in the
prompt, which assumed a single shared index. The IA derived the requirement
from the CTR update rules and reported it as a deviation. It was accepted as
the correct structure rather than a workaround, and it exposed that ITTAGE had
the same requirement and lacked the same bus.
That became TD #66's counterpart, TD #76, closed across BP-046 and
BP-048.

BP-046 mirrored the change into ITTAGE and renamed twenty-two
`ittage_cntrl` ports that cross the table boundary to the `t_`
convention. Renaming ports broke `tb_ittage_cntrl.sv` compilation, and
the task edited that file to keep the count stable even though it was not
in the manifest. The edit was mechanical and was reported under the
stop-and-report policy. The prompt-writing rule that followed is that a
task which renames a module's ports lists every instantiating testbench
in its manifest from the start.

The regression counts that BP-045 and BP-046 ran to confirm no behavioral
change reported something else. `sim_ittage_cntrl` returned 32 passing
and 44 failing. `sim_ittage_table` returned 30 and 2. Neither figure had
appeared in any status file. `tb_ittage_cntrl.sv` had been authored green
at 76 checks several sessions earlier; the ITTAGE RTL had changed
underneath it repeatedly since, and that suite had not been run again.
The proven-by-readback claims from the intervening work were true, but
they were made against directed rows in `tb_ittage`, not against the
controller suite, and `PROJECT_STATUS.md` carried the stale 76 throughout.

## Classification is not adjudication

BP-047 ran triage and fixed nothing. It classified all 46 failures into
two root-cause groups.

Thirty-two were stale testbench scaffolding. Thirty of those traced to
one defect in the `pred_s0` task: it drove `tbl_hit_p1`,
`tbl_cntrl_bits_p1` and `tbl_pred_tgt_p1` before the p0-to-p1 posedge and
cleared them one time unit after it. The `prv_alt_scan` block in
`ittage_cntrl.sv` is classified `nba_sequent` because it reads a flop
output, as required. After `pred_val_p1` captures, the block evaluates
against the correct values, then re-evaluates against the cleared inputs
and produces zeros. Every failing check in TC-PRED-02 through TC-PRED-06
returned an actual value of zero regardless of stimulus, and TC-PRED-01,
which expects all zeros, passed trivially.

The remaining fourteen were classified as an RTL counter routing
inversion in `ittage_cntrl.sv`. The reasoning was that USE and EPC pass
under the same `using_primary` signal, which isolates the fault to the
CTR branch assignments.

That classification was diagnosed entirely against what the testbench
expected. TC-UPD-01 through TC-UPD-05 asserted that `using_primary=1`
should fire `alt_ctr_wr`, and the RTL fired `prm_ctr_wr`. Treating the
test as the reference makes the RTL wrong. Standard TAGE and ITTAGE
train the provider's counter toward the resolved outcome, which is the
opposite of what the tests expected. The repair task was therefore
required to load `ittage_cntrl_ctr_update_rules.md` and settle the
direction against the rules table before changing any code, with the
swap pre-authorized only if the document agreed with the test.

It did not. BP-048 read the 33-row table and found rows 2 through 17
govern the UP=0 regime with `alt_ctr_wr` as the governing strobe, and
rows 18 through 33 govern UP=1 with `prm_ctr_wr`. The RTL matched the
document on every row. All five test cases had the strobes transposed.
Only the tests were repaired; `g_ctr_upd` was not modified. Had the RTL
swap been pre-authorized on the strength of the classification, a
conforming block would have been broken and the suite would have gone
green over it.

BP-048 also fixed a real RTL defect in the same task. `t_alc_index_u0`
was driven from the primary update index rather than from the allocation
index field carried in the prediction metadata. No existing test could
see it, because the test fixture happened to make `alc_idx` equal
`prm_idx`. TC-UPD-06 was modified so the two differ, the modified test
was shown to fail before the fix and pass after, and the defect was
corrected against `ittage_cntrl_alloc_rules.md`.

One item did not resolve. On TC-UPD-05 the automated task found two
authority documents in conflict: rows 22 through 29 of the CTR rules
table imply the primary strobe fires on a null counter under
misprediction with the data saturating at zero, while
`ittage_cntrl_decisions.md` stated there is no counter write in that
case. The task chose the rules table, called the decisions note
subordinate implementation guidance, and updated the test to match the
RTL. Test and RTL then agreed, and the suite was green. Agreement
between two artifacts is not evidence when the authority governing both
is itself in dispute. The resolution was a specification change rather
than a code change: `ittage_cntrl_decisions.md` gained a "Concurrent CTR
and TGT Writes" section relaxing the mutual-exclusivity claim, on the
grounds that writing zero to a counter already at zero has no effect.

## A defect reported and argued away

TD #57 covered the ITTAGE target write path, which had never been
audited. BP-049 verified that the target is written when the provider's
counter is zero on misprediction, added four directed tests covering both
provider regimes, and took the suite from 81 to 105 checks with no
failures. It marked itself complete and reported TD #57 closed.

In its own notes it recorded that the per-table target write enable in
`ittage_table.sv` gated on `(prm_match | alt_match)`, so a target write
reached every hitting table rather than only the provider. It classified
this as existing behavior not prohibited by the specification, and stated
that the incidental update had no observable effect on correctness.

Both statements were wrong. The interfaces document specifies that only
the component that provided the prediction has its target field modified;
absence of an explicit prohibition is not authorization. The effect is
also observable. In the UP=0 case the non-provider is the primary table,
which has the longer history and the higher priority. Its target field is overwritten
with a value resolved under a different history length, and on the next
prediction at that address the primary hits and is selected as provider
ahead of the alternate. The corrupted entry is the one consulted first.

The tests could not have caught it. Each read back only the entry it
expected to change. A test that verifies a write landed says nothing
about whether a second write landed somewhere it should not have. The
same blind spot had produced the `alc_index` defect one task earlier.

BP-049a ran with `ittage_interfaces.md` in the manifest, where the
provider-only invariant is stated explicitly, and the defect was fixed
rather than rationalized. The single `t_tgt_wr_u0` strobe was split into
`t_prm_tgt_wr_u0`, asserted only for UP=1 with the primary counter at
zero, and `t_alt_tgt_wr_u0`, asserted only for UP=0 with the alternate
counter at zero. The table's target write enable became
`prm_tgt_wr & prm_match | alt_tgt_wr & alt_match`, mutually exclusive by
construction, with the non-provider gating to zero in both regimes. The
tests were extended to read back the non-provider entry and assert it
unchanged. Both extended checks failed before the fix and passed after,
with the failing values showing the exact corruption: expected `c000`,
actual `e000`, and expected `c000`, actual `b000`.

An earlier attempt in the same task passed `using_primary` into the table
and gated there. It was backed out after Verilator scheduling on
partial-bit generate assignments produced incorrect results. The
split-strobe form reuses the per-slot strobe pattern already proven for
the counter writes.

## Showing that a check can fail

BP-050 took up the ITTAGE epoch write. It found the write enable
provider-only, added tests that read back both the provider and the
non-provider entry, and passed. It was abandoned.

The gate was correct and the finding was right, but the task never
demonstrated that its non-provider check could fail. It argued that a
`(prm_match | alt_match)` defect would make the check trip. It did not
run the test against a defective design to find out. A test that has
only ever been run against conforming RTL is indistinguishable from a
test that cannot fail, and BP-049 had just shown what that costs.

BP-050b redid the work with the missing step. The epoch write enable was
established as provider-only by construction: it rides the mutually
exclusive primary and alternate counter strobes, and the epoch write
condition is a strict subset of the counter write condition, so no path
writes the epoch field without also writing the counter. No RTL change
was required. Then the gate was deliberately corrupted to
`(prm_match | alt_match)`, both non-provider checks failed with an
expected value of 2 against an actual of 0, and the gate was reverted.

Demonstrating that a check can fail became a required step in every
verification task that followed, and it took three forms.

Where a defect was fixed, the test ran against the unfixed design first.
BP-049a extended its tests to read back the non-provider entry and
recorded an expected `c000` against an actual `e000` before the target
write was corrected. BP-051 added the missing UAON guard, removed it
again to watch TC-UAON-08 return an expected 8 against an actual 9, and
restored it.

Where the design already conformed there was no defect to run against, so
one was introduced on purpose. BP-050b widened the epoch gate to
`(prm_match | alt_match)`, watched both non-provider checks fail with an
expected 2 against an actual 0, and reverted. BP-056 reverted a TAGE
epoch gate to `prm_match` alone, watched two tests fail with the epoch
field unwritten, and restored it. BP-057 removed the guard it had just
added and watched the counter move. Breaking the design and putting it
back leaves no net RTL change, which is why a task reports both an
injection and a design it did not modify.

Where neither applied, the discrimination came from the stimulus. BP-052
seeds a pre-state of USE=2'b10 so an aging-disabled result cannot be
mistaken for an age-1 result. BP-058 seeds USE=10 in TC-87 for the same
reason. BP-060 seeds `pred_strong` at 111 against the weak boundary 100
so the bit has to move for the test to pass.

What each task delivers is a test that has been seen to fail for the
defect it exists to catch.

BP-050 produced one more finding. Running every target in the Makefile
rather than the one target under test revealed that `tb_ittage_cntrl.sv`
and `tb_ittage_table.sv` did not compile at all. BP-049a had renamed
`t_tgt_wr_u0` across `ittage_cntrl.sv` and `ittage_table.sv` and had run
only `sim_ittage`. The 77 and 32 passing counts recorded as current truth
in the session handoff were false from the moment of the rename. BP-050a
enumerated all twenty targets, repaired both testbenches with no RTL
change, and the escape was recorded as BUG-002. BP-050's own claim to
have repaired them did not hold either, which is how the same class of
error appeared twice one task apart.

The rule that came out of this is that every simulation and lint target
in the Makefile runs, whether or not it is a dependency of `all`, and
that status counts come from a run in the current session. Its cost is
measurable. BP-054a ran for three and a half minutes and consumed 72% of
context, almost entirely from twenty-two targets' console output.
Compaction occurred in eight of the eleven tasks in the final session. A
phased application of the rule, so that early tasks in a sequence run
fewer targets, is the planned revision.

## Completing ITTAGE

With the epoch write proven, the remaining ITTAGE items ran in
dependency order. Aging reads the epoch field, so the epoch write is
proven first.

BP-051 found the second real RTL defect of the range. The UAON update
block was missing its single-hit guard: with either component count at
zero the counter should hold, and without the guard a single-hit
transaction with a stale alternate target defaulting to zero could move
it on a comparison carrying no training signal. The guard was added and
proven by removal, TC-UAON-08 failing with an expected 8 against an
actual 9. The fix invalidated a test elsewhere. `tc_tgt_b_ext` in
`tb_ittage` had encoded its UAON decrement step around the missing guard,
using a single-hit scenario that only produced a decrement because the
guard was absent. It was rewritten as a two-hit setup.

BP-052 proved the aging and epoch path, dark until this point. All seven
rules conformed. The task found that the epoch advances the tick after
the interval reaches zero rather than on it, and wrote its tests to match
the RTL while noting the document did not specify the boundary. Matching
the RTL where the specification is silent is the same move BP-047 made
against the tests, and it was handled the same way: the behavior was
adjudicated rather than assumed, and the N+1 timing was added to
`tage_cntrl_use_update_rules.md` so the test encodes a documented
requirement rather than an observation.

BP-053 proved the thirteen allocation rules with no RTL change and found
a specification error. The write-data field order in the allocation rules
document did not match the structural entry layout, with the target and
epoch fields transposed. Rather than correct one document, the field
order was extracted into `ittage_table_entry_formats.md` and
`tage_table_entry_formats.md` as the single source, referenced from the
interface documents. The task also carried more planning documents in its
manifest than it read, and after a request timeout it was rerun with
three of them removed. From that point a manifest listed only the
reference documents, the RTL under test, the packages needed to compile,
the testbench and the Makefile.

BP-054 proved the twelve prediction-path rules and found two further
specification errors, both carried across from TAGE. `ittage_pred_strong`
was documented as the provider counter differing from 3 and from 4, which
is the TAGE weak-band definition for a direction counter. ITTAGE's
counter is a confidence counter and the correct condition is non-zero.
Separately, the final-target section referred to a single stored
`ittage_pred_tgt` field. It was rewritten so the consumer selects between
the primary and alternate targets using `ittage_using_primary`, which
avoids storing a third 35 to 40 bit target. BP-054a confirmed the
corrected document against the RTL and testbench with no code change.

BP-055 ran the ITTAGE round-trip capstone across counter, usefulness,
allocation, epoch and target writes in one flow. Its first failure was
again a test defect rather than an RTL defect. IT3 was seeded with an
epoch value of 3 against a local epoch of 0, giving an age of 1 and an
effective usefulness of `USE>>1`, which is zero. The usefulness increment
then wrote 1 over a seed of 1 and produced no visible change. Three
expectations were corrected. The rule recorded from it is that when a
usefulness delta must be observable, the epoch field is seeded equal to
the local epoch so the effective and raw values agree.

## TAGE, the same sequence

The ITTAGE sequence became the template for TAGE, and the outcomes
mirrored it closely enough to be useful as a comparison.

BP-056 proved the TAGE epoch write. The gate had been changed in an
earlier hand fix to `prm_match | alt_match` and never proven. The local
epoch was forced to `2'b10` against a seeded epoch of `00` so the write
was a visible change rather than a rewrite of the same value. Injection
reverted the gate to `prm_match` alone and the two alternate-match tests
returned with the epoch field unwritten. The TAGE epoch write rides the
usefulness write enable, not the counter subset relation that ITTAGE
uses; the two predictors reach the same invariant by different structures.

BP-057 found the fourth defect, and it is the ITTAGE defect from BP-051
in the other predictor. The `uaon_upd_ff` gate was missing
`&& u_alt_tagged[s]`. When the provider hit a tagged table and the
alternate fell through to the untagged base table T0, the counter moved
on a comparison with no tag behind it. The two-line guard was added, TC-81
failed before and passed after. The TAGE manifestation is more specific
than the ITTAGE one: not merely a single hit, but a tagged provider with
an untagged alternate.

BP-058 proved the aging path with no RTL change, confirming
`age = (lcl_epoch - EPC) mod 4` and an effective usefulness of the raw
value at age 0, a right shift at age 1, and zero at age 2 or greater. One
test seeds usefulness at `11` so the four ages produce `11`, `01`, `00`
and `00`, which distinguishes a wrong age from a right one. Another
proves the behavioral consequence rather than the counter value: a fresh
entry is not an allocation candidate, and the same entry aged to an
effective usefulness of zero is. Unlike the ITTAGE interval, the TAGE
aging interval is a 32-bit input port rather than a static parameter, so
the boundary is always reachable and there is no risk of a mechanism
untestable at current parameters.

BP-059 proved allocation and folded RAM-level write isolation into the
same task rather than deferring it to the capstone, since the task
already ran at `sim_tage` with the tables present. The selected table is
read back changed and a non-selected table seeded to a distinct value is
read back unchanged. This is the check the ITTAGE allocation task could
not reach, having run controller-only. The write-data field order was
cross-checked against the entry-format document and matched, so the
transposition found in ITTAGE has no TAGE counterpart.

The task also corrected the prompt rather than the design. The
requirement asked for a no-consecutive-skip test, a description carried
over from the ITTAGE allocation work. The TAGE guard is
`alc_comp_p1[s] == 0`, which stops the scan at the first candidate rather
than skipping past a selected table. The two policies differ only when
two allocatable candidates are adjacent, which the seeded stimulus did
not produce, so the test proves first-match selection and the label was
corrected to match.

BP-060 proved the prediction path with no RTL change. The
`pred_strong` definition was the specific item under watch, given the
carryover error found in the ITTAGE document. The TAGE document states
the provider counter differs from 3 and from 4, the RTL implements
`(ctr != 3'b011) && (ctr != 3'b100)`, and they agree. The carryover ran
one direction only.

BP-061 closed the range with the TAGE round-trip capstone. Entries were
placed to collide at a single RAM address, with T1 through T4 all mapping
to index 512, which is the arrangement most likely to expose a cross-path
write. Aging was disabled and the epoch seeded equal to the local epoch
so usefulness deltas stayed visible, applying the BP-055 lesson directly.
The interference checks confirm that a counter and epoch write survive a
usefulness write to a different table, and that an allocation disturbs
neither the provider entry nor a fourth-table reference held constant
through all four steps. One field is not discriminating: with the epoch
equal to the local epoch throughout, the epoch writes are zero over zero,
so a stuck value would pass. Epoch landing is proven separately with a
real delta and an injection, and the capstone's purpose is interference.

## Counts as evidence

Four times in this range a status count was carried forward without a run
behind it.

The controller suite carried 76 passing through several sessions of RTL
churn without being re-run. BP-049a's rename left two testbenches
uncompilable while their previous counts were recorded as current. BP-050
claimed a repair that had not held. And the TAGE arithmetic did not close
across three consecutive tasks: one task reported 69, the next added five
test cases and reported 73, which resolves only if the prior baseline was
68; the task after that reported a pass with no integer at all, which
does not satisfy a rule requiring a count from the current session. The
ledger closed once an integer was produced again, at which point the
whole chain of 73, 81, 87, 95, 102 and 103 reconciled end to end.

The pattern is the same as the one the injection step addresses. A count
and a passing test are both assertions about a system's state, and both
are worth exactly as much as the run that produced them.

## What comes next

Both predictors close this range directed-validated at the unit level.
The items that remain are deferred rather than open questions: the
`sram_init` non-fast path for both units, rollback and history recompute,
which move to cluster integration, the dual-slot configuration, the
ITTAGE counter width reduction from three bits to two, and a missing
fast-init simulation target. The counter width reduction will churn any
counter and aging tests written before it lands, which argues for doing
it before further ITTAGE test work rather than after.

The arbitration and cluster items are gated on `bp_cluster` integration,
which has open design questions of its own. The next predictor units
(FTB, SC and RAS) are not started. The directed-validation sequence used
here is the template for them.

## Technical Debt Referenced

The table below reports status as of the close of this range. Later
experiments outside the range have since changed the state of some items
carried alongside these.

| # | Item | Resolution path |
|---|---|---|
| 55 | tage EPC write proof. Changed RTL, never proven by readback. | CLOSED BP-056. epc_we gate changed as a USE rider in earlier work. Seed entry, drive EPC-writing update, read EPC back via prediction, confirm landing. |
| 56 | ittage EPC write proof. Changed RTL, never proven by readback. | CLOSED BP-050b. epc_we_s0/s1 fixed alongside use_we with no positive test. Readback-verify per provider, UP=1 and UP=0. |
| 57 | ittage TGT target replacement. Untested. Successor to #51. | CLOSED BP-049a. Suspect for the same provider-gating defect as CTR and USE. Target written on mispredict when CTR null only. Trace path, readback-verify reachable rows. ITTAGE only; TAGE has no target field. |
| 58 | tage UAON trigger rules. Tested only as setup, never as DUT. | CLOSED BP-057. tage_cntrl_uaon_update_rules.md promoted from Draft to authority, directed test per row, use_alt_on_na asserted and cleared per rule. BUG-003 found and fixed. |
| 59 | ittage UAON trigger rules. Tested only as setup, never as DUT. | CLOSED BP-051. ittage_cntrl_uaon_update_rules.md promoted from Draft. USE tests had relied on UAON asserting as a precondition without it ever being verified. |
| 60 | tage aging / epoch path. Entire path dark. | CLOSED BP-058. Supersedes #41. All prior tests ran with tage_enable_aging=0. Drive aging enabled, exercise EPC-versus-epoch compare and USE decrement over the interval. |
| 61 | ittage aging / epoch path. Entire path dark. | CLOSED BP-052. Same as #60 for ITTAGE. Consumes the EPC field whose write changed in earlier work; see #56. |
| 62 | tage allocation policy + write gating. Never the feature under test. Successor to #51. | CLOSED BP-059. Allocation had been treated as residue to invalidate, never verified. Which table allocates, write-enable gating, allocation index. RAM-level write isolation verified. |
| 63 | ittage allocation policy + gating. Never the feature under test. Successor to #51. | CLOSED BP-053. Same as #62. Allocation on mispredict, CTR-null condition, alloc_we gating, allocated entry state read back. |
| 64 | tage prediction-side correctness. Not directed-tested. | CLOSED BP-060. Prediction path had been exercised only as setup for update tests. Directed-test provider selection, using_primary, pred_strong and the target mux against seeded entries. |
| 65 | ittage prediction-side correctness. Not directed-tested. | CLOSED BP-054 and BP-054a. Same as #64 for ITTAGE. Resolves the #42 test aspect: provider, using_primary and target operate at s2, not s3. |
| 66 | TAGE structural rework. Per-table 2D update and allocation buses where shared per-slot buses are correct. Sequence before TAGE allocation #62. | CLOSED BP-045. Collapsed to shared per-slot buses routed by the existing selects; t_alt_upd_index_u0 added for the concurrent primary and alternate CTR write case. |
| 71 | tage round-trip. Combined test, run only after individual tests pass. | CLOSED BP-061. Mixed CTR, USE, allocation and EPC in one flow. Run only after #55, #58, #60, #62 and #64 were each proven alone; mixing before isolation reproduces multi-cause ambiguity. |
| 72 | ittage round-trip capstone. Combined test, run only after individual tests pass. | CLOSED BP-055. Mixed CTR, USE, allocation, EPC and TGT in one flow, after #56, #57, #59, #61, #63 and #65. Allocation RAM-level write isolation verified. |
| 76 | ittage should have independent index buses for primary and alternate table updates. | CLOSED across BP-046 and BP-048. History lengths differ and indices are hashed per length, so primary and alternate updates require separate buses. The t_alc_index_u0 source defect was the remainder, closed in BP-048. |

## Design Process Notes

### What the implementation assistant contributed

The implementation assistant produced every directed test in the range,
approximately 120 test cases across the two predictors, each citing the
specification row it exercises. It root-caused four RTL defects to file
and line and fixed them in the same session, and it produced the
diagnostic reasoning behind the largest failure group in BP-047, the
`nba_sequent` re-evaluation against cleared inputs, which required
tracing Verilator block classification rather than reading a failing
comparison.

Three of the range's specification errors were found by the
implementation assistant reporting a discrepancy it was not asked to
look for: the allocation write-data field order, the `pred_strong`
carryover, and the stored final-target field. In BP-045 it went further and
contradicted the task itself, deriving the three-index bus requirement from
the CTR update rules and reporting the prompt's single-index assumption as
wrong. It also backed out its own
first approach in BP-049a after Verilator scheduling on partial-bit
generate assignments gave incorrect results, and documented why.

Its failure mode in this range was uniform. Where the task allowed
judgment about what a finding meant, it resolved toward the artifact in
front of it: BP-047 treated the testbench as the reference for the
counter direction, BP-049 treated the absence of an explicit prohibition
as authorization, BP-050 argued a check's discriminating power instead of
demonstrating it, and BP-052 wrote tests to match RTL behavior the
document did not specify. In each case the reasoning is defensible in
isolation and wrong against the specification. The pattern is not
carelessness in execution; it is the absence of the authority document at
the moment the judgment was made.

### What the planning assistant contributed

The planning assistant scoped and sequenced all twenty-one tasks,
including the dependency order that put every epoch write proof before
its corresponding aging proof, and the isolation-before-round-trip
ordering that held both capstones until every path was proven alone.

Its most consequential contribution was the guard on BP-048. Presented
with a classification naming the RTL as inverted, it identified that the
diagnosis rested entirely on the testbench being correct, and required
the repair task to settle the direction against the rules table before
changing code, with the swap pre-authorized only on the document's
agreement. The document disagreed and a conforming block was left alone.

It also caught the argued-not-demonstrated gap in BP-050 and the
rationalized defect in BP-049, and identified the count arithmetic
failures across BP-055 through BP-058.

Its own errors were in scope and in labelling. Manifests were oversized
on several tasks, once contributing to a timeout, and the manifest
omission on BP-049, which left the interfaces document out, is the
direct cause of the rationalized target-write defect. The BP-059 requirement
carried a no-consecutive-skip label across from the ITTAGE allocation
work when the TAGE policy is stop-at-first, which is the same
cross-track contamination that appeared in the specification documents,
in a prompt rather than a design file.

### What the architect contributed

Every expected value in the range originated with the architect, as did
every specification correction. The rejection of BP-049's completion
claim, the decision to extract the entry field order into standalone
format documents rather than patch one rules table, the ruling that the
N+1 epoch timing belonged in the aging document rather than only in a
test, and the judgment that the epoch wrap needed no documentation
change were all architect decisions.

The all-targets rule and its planned phased revision are also architect
decisions, made after measuring the rule's context cost rather than
before.

### The generalization

Sixteen of the twenty-one tasks were verification work, and twelve of
those ended with no RTL change. The design conformed to its specification
nearly everywhere it was checked, which means the range's output is
almost entirely tests, and their passing does not establish what they are
worth.

A test written against conforming RTL and never run against anything else
has an unknown detection capability. It may encode the requirement, or it
may encode whatever the design does. The two are indistinguishable from
the outside, and both produce the same green result. Separating them is
cheap. Break the design in the way the test claims to detect, confirm the
test fails, restore. Where there is nothing to break, choose stimulus
that makes a wrong answer visible. The values recorded in this range are
what make the passing results mean anything. An expected 2 returned 0
when the epoch gate was widened. An expected 8 returned 9 when the UAON
guard was removed. An expected `c000` returned `e000` against the
uncorrected target write path. Each took minutes.

The same principle explains the range's other failures, which are not
about tests at all. A count carried forward is an assertion about a
system state without a run behind it. A defect reported and argued
harmless is an assertion about consequences without a test behind it. A
classification that names the RTL as inverted is an assertion about which
artifact is authoritative without an adjudication behind it. Each was
plausible, and each was wrong or unproven in the direction that would
have cost the most: the rationalized target write would have corrupted
the higher-priority table, and the RTL swap would have broken a block
that conformed on all 33 rows.

The two predictors provide the range's one controlled comparison. The
same UAON defect exists in both, found independently by the same directed
method rather than by transferring the fix, and the TAGE manifestation is
more specific than the ITTAGE one. Where a document error crossed from
one predictor to the other, the directed test on the receiving side found
it, and the deliberate check of the same item on the originating side
came back clean. A method that finds the same class of defect twice in
two independent implementations, and that distinguishes a genuine
carryover from a suspected one, is doing something a single pass cannot
demonstrate.
